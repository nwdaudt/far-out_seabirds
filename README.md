# Seabirds off Northland, Aotearoa New Zealand

This is a work in progress---the README and files will be constantly being updated (**i.e. this is a draft**).

In this study, we use a mix of descriptive statistics, rarefaction curves, and model-based multivariate statistics to describe assemblages of seabird species off Northland, Aotearoa New Zealand, and to investigate if environmental parameters help to explain spatial/temporal variations.

The [Far Out Ocean Research Collective](https://www.farout.org.nz/) works in the rohe (territory) of the Māori iwi (tribe) Ngāti Kuri, who has custody of the data. The raw data (probably) won't be open; however, we hope to make some data available eventually.
